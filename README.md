<!--STORY GOES HERE (TOGGLE MENU)-->
<details>
 <summary><h2>👉🏻📖 My Journey in tech.</h2></summary>
 
 ### Discovering programming by accident
 ---
I was first introduced to programming as a child around 13 or 14, by poking around demo versions of PC games. 

I intended to try to develop my own “cracks” so I could play the full version for free. 

Of course, that was way beyond the scope of a beginner. I did discover, however, that I could open certain files with a text editor, and amongst the spaces, brackets, and equals signs I would later learn was known as <i>syntax</i> I would find integers or Boolean values, that if I edited, would have an effect on gameplay.

In my teenage years, I began to make mods for video games. I would develop new game maps, and textures, and learn how to modify code with a simple text editor and no formal training on syntax. I managed to create some interesting mods for several games, however, I never thought to become a programmer. 

### Overcoming financial struggles by God's grace and supporting my parents
---
Due to the severe financial struggles of my family, I started working straight out of high school. Some shifts would be grueling 12-, 14-, or 16-hour shifts at various locations. Restaurants, retail outlets. Essentially whatever employment I could garner to help provide for myself and my parents. 

### Working as a Lead Technician and my original plan: become a healthcare worker
---
I attended college in 2018 intending to pursue a healthcare career as a pharmacist.

I always did well in my classes, and by the time I gained my associates, I also obtained my Pharmacy Technician License and received a promotion as Lead Pharmacy Technician in the community pharmacy where I work.

 
### An A student changes his educational trajectory
---
I temporarily put off my bachelor's to work extra hours during the Covid 19 Pandemic, serving at my home pharmacy and other pharmacies in the NYC Queens district. 

This also gave me time to think about what I wanted to do. I learned that I enjoy engineering and mathematics much more than healthcare-related topics (I studied calculus 1, 2, and 3 in college, calculus-based physics, and in my own time studied discrete mathematics). I also wanted to solve problems at scale and provide as much value as possible.

### Becoming a Software Engineer
---
I went back to college to take advanced mathematics courses and physics courses. I began to consider my options as an Engineer. I also began to learn programming on my own. 
I was invited to study Electrical Engineering at Grove School of Engineering in NYC but opted to study Software Engineering at Western Governors University.

I was also fortunate enough to be awarded the opportunity to study Data Engineering with Per Scholas. 

This marks the beginning of my journey as a programmer and data engineer. It feels oddly familiar, coming back to my roots.
