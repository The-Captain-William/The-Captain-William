<details>
 <summary><h3>The Power of Programming: My Journey Learning to Code.</h3></summary>
 
 ### "Bumping" into coding at an early age
 ---
I was first introduced to programming as a child around 13 or 14, by poking around demo versions of PC games. 

My intent was to try to develop my own ‚Äúcracks‚Äù so I can play the full version for free. 

Of course, that was way beyond the scope of a beginner. I did discover, however, that I could open certain files with a text editor, and amongst the spaces, brackets, and equals signs I would later learn was known as <i>syntax</i> I would find integers or Boolean values, that if I edited, would have an effect on gameplay when I ran the game again. 

In my teenage years, I began to make mods for video games. I would develop new game maps, and textures, and learn how to modify code with a simple text editor and no formal training on syntax. I managed to create some interesting mods for several games, however, I never thought to become a programmer. 

### Overcoming financial struggles by God's grace and supporting my parents
---
Due to the severe financial struggles my family had, I started working straight out of high school. Some shifts would be grueling 12-, 14-, or 16-hour shifts back-to-back at various locations. Restaurants, retail outlets. Essentially whatever employment I could garner to help provide for myself and my parents. 

### Working as a Lead Technician and my original plan: become a healthcare worker
---
I attended college in 2018 with the intention of pursuing a healthcare career as a pharmacist.

I always did well in my classes, and by the time I gained my associates I also gained my Pharmacy Technician License, and I was promoted to Lead Pharmacy Technician in the community pharmacy where I work.

 
### An A student changes his educational trajectory
---
I put off my bachelor's temporarily to work extra hours during the Covid 19 Pandemic, serving at both my home pharmacy and other pharmacies in the NYC Queens district. 

This also gave me some time to think about what I really wanted to do. I learned that I enjoy engineering and mathematics much more than healthcare-related topics (I studied calculus 1, 2, and 3 in college, as well as calculus-based physics, and studied discrete mathematics in my own time). I also knew that I wanted to solve problems at large and provide as much value as possible. As a single individual, I can only serve so many people. 

### Decided to become an Engineer and my acceptance at Per Scholas
---
I went back to college to take advanced mathematics courses and physics courses. I began to consider my options as an Engineer. I also began to learn programming on my own. 
I was invited to come to study  Electrical Engineering at Grove School of Engineering in NYC but opted to study Software Engineering at Western Governors University instead.

I was also fortunate enough to be awarded the opportunity to study Data Engineering with Per Scholas. 

This marks the beginning of my journey as a programmer and data engineer. It feels oddly familiar, coming back to my roots. I feel like I was meant to do this my entire life but just didn‚Äôt see it. I‚Äôm excited to begin learning new skills and developing the skillset I have so I can reach my vision of helping to reach as many people as possible and solving as many problems as possible, by developing the systems necessary that do just that.

## Projects ‚Üó

### [Project 1: ETL Pipeline with Python and SQL](https://github.com/The-Captain-William/Per-Scholas-Capstone/tree/main#per-scholas-data-engineering-bootcamp-capstone-project)

- Developed an end-to-end ETL pipeline using Python, PySpark, and SQL, extracting data from various sources, performing data transformations, and loading it into a relational database.
- Implemented efficient data processing techniques to handle large datasets, ensuring data integrity and accuracy.
- Utilized SQL queries to optimize database performance and enhance query execution time.
- Developed a Windows desktop application to view the dataset


## Education

- Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering, Western Governors University. Expected Graduation: 2023
- Associates in Science with an emphasis on biology, calculus (1-3), and calculus-based physics 
- Relevant coursework: Data Structures, Algorithms, Database Management Systems, Software Engineering


## Interests

Apart from coding, I have a keen interest in staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in technology. I also love motorcycles, reading, lifting weights, and being outdoors. I also love Chinese culture and language, and I'm studying Mandarin Chinese with the goal of becoming fluent.

If you're looking for a highly motivated junior software engineer who is eager to learn, grow, and make a positive impact, I would love to connect with you. Let's collaborate and create something amazing together!
